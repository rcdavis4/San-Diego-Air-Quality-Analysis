# San-Diego-Air-Quality-Analysis
Data Analysis of PM2.5 in San Diego County from 2022-2025

## Project Objective
To analyze monthly PM2.5 concentration levels in San Diego County, mapping out potential areas of concern that exceed the EPA's 2024 standard of 9.0 µg/m³. Visualizing these levels will give insights for public health officials and residents to target interventions and make informed outdoor activity decisions.

## Problem Statements 
1. How have average monthly PM2.5 levels changed in San Diego County over the last 3 years (2022-2025), and which areas most frequently exceed the EPA's safety threshold of 9.0 µg/m³?
2. Which neighborhoods or monitoring stations in San Diego County consistently show the highest PM2.5 levels relative to other areas, and how do these pollution hotspots compare to the county average?
3. What impact do wildfires have on local PM2.5 concentrations?
